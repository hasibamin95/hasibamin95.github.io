Hi, I am Hasib! I'm a PhD candidate in the [Intelligent Circuits, Architectures, AND Systems (iCAS)](https://www.icaslab.com/) Lab at the University of South Carolina, advised by [Dr. Ramtin Zand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramtinzand/).

My research interest lies in circuit-, system- and architecture-level optimization of analog Processing-in-Memory (PIM) systems. At the circuit level, my work investigates the reliability concerns due to parasitics and noise. In the system level, my focus is on software-hardware co-design and co-optimization of NN models on PIM hardware. My architecture-level work focuses on heterogeneous integration of PIM and other computing systems such as CPU, TPU for various CNN and LLM workloads.
